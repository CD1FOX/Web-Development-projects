            <p>
                I’m Francis Leo Lusdoc, an aspiring fullstack developer who loves learning and building things from scratch. 
                My goal is to master both frontend and backend development so I can create projects that help others. 
                I enjoy designing websites, coding, and exploring how technology can solve real problems. 
                What makes me unique is my curiosity and drive to keep improving every single day.
